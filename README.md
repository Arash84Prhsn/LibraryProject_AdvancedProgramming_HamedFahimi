# Library Management Project

This project is meant to simulate a program that would process all aspects of managing a library but since this project isn't robust enough nor does it have a GUI, it just simulates such
a managing program.

## The library

The library has the following properties:

`Name` , `ID` , `ListOfBooks` , `ListOfEmployees`
